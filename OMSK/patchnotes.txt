rcsfx on lunik

integrated optional "Omich-L MPL" lab

switchable textures of SM-65 are shared between parts instead of duplicating

Textures of SM-65 are toned up to merge with widely used Porkjet White color

SM-65 sustainer is gimballed as supposed to

added batteries to tanks that have gyros

waterfall configurations, shamelessly "inspired" by Restock-Waterfall configurations by Nertea
